**We now support down to 768 pixels of a screen 🤏**
This means you can use Ask Box on smol laptops, tablets, and even phones in landscape position, with _complete_ functionality.

**You can now `Cmd K` (or `Ctrl K`) from anywhere to start a new chat 🧼**
You no longer need to focus on the ask box first.
Even better, the ask box will be focused automatically for you to start a new chat right away.

We also support **`Cmd B`** and **`Cmd Shift B`** to toggle the home and settings panels, respectively.
For our friends on Windows and Linux, they will be `Ctrl B` and `Ctrl Shift B`.

**We use an emoji as our favicon 📮**
This is a short term solution while we are working with a real designer instead of me.
There's no meaning here, don't read too much into it.
It's just an emoji that will stand out in your hundred of tabs.

* 👉 **Try it now on [ask.box](https://ask.box),** and tell us what we should do next.
* 🙇 Thanks @Nhi Ly for requesting this (who actually did not say "favicon" but "something on the sidebar", hopefully it's favicon)
