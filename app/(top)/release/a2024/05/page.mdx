OpenAI's latest model GPT-4o is now available on ask.box.
Reasons to switch to to GPT-4o from GPT4-Turbo:
- Most advanced model
- 2x faster with half the price (extend ask.box runway!!!)
- Best for chatting in Vietnamese

**We widened the chat area,** so you can scroll anywhere on the screen.
The scrollbar now stays at the edge, so it should never collide with your text.
Even better, we did this without impacting the recent

**You can now `Cmd K` (or `Ctrl K`) from anywhere to start a new chat 🧼**
You no longer need to focus on the ask box first.
Even better, the ask box will be focused automatically for you to start a new chat right away.

We also support **`Cmd B`** and **`Cmd Shift B`** to toggle the home and settings panels, respectively.
For our friends on Windows and Linux, they will be `Ctrl B` and `Ctrl Shift B`.

**We use an emoji as our favicon 📮**
This is a short term solution while we are working with a real designer instead of me.
There's no meaning here, don't read too much into it.
It's just an emoji that will stand out in your hundred of tabs.

* 🙇 Thanks @Nhi Ly for requesting this (who actually did not say "favicon" but "something on the sidebar", hopefully it's favicon)
