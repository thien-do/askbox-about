**Ask Box just got enhanced animation 🎮**
We've overhauled the motion design for both side boxes,
making them not only appear more natural but also significantly smoother.
Try it now on 👉 **[ask.box](https://ask.box)** 👈

🎁 **Bonus for Devs:** Behind the scene,
we completely eliminated all layout calculations during the animation.
This means the animation can be off-loaded completely to GPU,
making it not only smoother, but also saving CPU resources for other things.
To learn more, see the build note below.

<ReleaseBuild>
**Let's start with production, that is, `ask.box` at the moment.**
This is how it looks when you open or close the side panel.
You may feel that it's smooth enough, but we can do much better.
Notice that the "layout" calculation is as much as "style" calculation.
That's not great, because "layout" is much more expensive.

<ReleaseVideo src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dltbv060k/video/upload/v1743843050/1_oq4mlr.mov" />

The reason why we need to trigger "layout" is because we are animating "width" (not great).
We need to animate "width" because it's not possible to resize with "scale" (great!)
while keeping the border and border radius intact.
Notice the card: it is expanding while side collapsing,
but its border and border radius stay the same.
We thought this performance is the best compromise to have the beautiful animation.

**But we was wrong. We can do better**

This is the same animation that we are working on.
This is the ultimate animation: there's absolutely zero "layout" calculation!
The "style" calculation is as much as the current version, but no "layout":

OpenAI's latest model GPT-4o is now available on ask.box
Reasons to switch to to GPT-4o from GPT4-Turbo:
- Most advanced model
- 2x faster with half the price (extend ask.box runway!!!)
- Best for chatting in Vietnamese

Ask Box just got better 🚀

**We widened the chat area,** so you can scroll anywhere on the screen.
The scrollbar now stays at the edge, so it should never collide with your text.
Even better, we did this without impacting the recent

**We now support down to 768 pixels of a screen 🤏**
This means you can use Ask Box on smol laptops, tablets, and even phones in landscape position, with _complete_ functionality.

**You can now `Cmd K` (or `Ctrl K`) from anywhere to start a new chat 🧼**
You no longer need to focus on the ask box first.
Even better, the ask box will be focused automatically for you to start a new chat right away.

We also support **`Cmd B`** and **`Cmd Shift B`** to toggle the home and settings panels, respectively.
For our friends on Windows and Linux, they will be `Ctrl B` and `Ctrl Shift B`.

**We use an emoji as our favicon 📮**
This is a short term solution while we are working with a real designer instead of me.
There's no meaning here, don't read too much into it.
It's just an emoji that will stand out in your hundred of tabs.

* 🙇 Thanks @Nhi Ly for requesting this (who actually did not say "favicon" but "something on the sidebar", hopefully it's favicon)
