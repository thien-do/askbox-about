## Subscription and Billing

1. **Automatic Renewal:** Your AskBox subscription will automatically renew on the same date each month or year, depending on your chosen plan.
For months without a corresponding date, renewal occurs on the last day of the month.

2. **Pricing:** Initial promotional rates or discounts apply only to the first billing cycle.
Subsequent renewals will be charged at the current standard rate for your subscription tier.

3. **Payment Information:** AskBox reserves the right to suspend or terminate your subscription if we are unable to process payment due to outdated or incorrect payment information.

4. **Access:** Your right to use AskBox services is activated upon successful payment of the subscription fees.

## Cancellation Process

1. **Self-Service Cancellation:** To cancel your AskBox subscription, please use the cancellation option in your account settings on our website.
This is the only official method for cancellation.

2. **Cancellation Requests:** Please note that cancellation requests sent via email, phone, or other channels will not be processed.

3. **Service Continuation:** After cancelling, you will retain access to AskBox until the end of your current billing cycle.
For instance, if your subscription renews on the 15th of each month and you cancel on June 5th, you'll have access until July 14th.

## Refund Policy

1. **No Refunds for Partial Use:** As a general rule, AskBox does not provide refunds for partially used subscription periods.

2. **Exceptions for New Renewals:** If you've been charged for a new subscription period, you may request a full refund within 48 hours of the renewal date by contacting our customer support team.
   
3. **Refund Processing:** Approved refunds will be credited back to the original payment method within 14 business days.
