**We fixed a bug where companions went to retirement unexpectedly ðŸ§“**
Worry not that no companions are lost!
This is a linking issue, meaning that we only lost their name in rare cases,
but they are still there.
Rare cases include asking a question without making changes to any companion yet.

Our thanks to <ReleaseUser name="huy"/> for not only reporting the issue but also working with us to fix it.
