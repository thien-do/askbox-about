**We re-designed our file upload 🗄️**
It should now behave more predictable,
like what a normal human should expect:

- There's no longer a confusing central file manager.
Instead, you can just pick a file and start asking.

- Moreover, we stored recently uploaded files for 24 hours,
so you can just pick them in new conversation without uploading again.

This is based on feedback from…
almost everyone who tried the previous solution and fail.
Sorry for the inconvenience 🙇

Thien finally uses tooltip, sadly

What do we think about the "i" icon?
Is it too… Latin?
Should we use "?" and "!" instead?
Are they more universally understood?
