**We have complete authentication support ðŸ¥·**
This goes from basic stuff like sign up and sign in to
a full-featured account management with multiple-email and device history âœ¨

**In the near future, signed in users will have more benefits,**
such as higher usage limit, better models,
and the privilege of sending us money (to pay for the models, of course).

**As always, privacy is our first priority.**
Even if you signed in, chats are always stored in your devices only.
