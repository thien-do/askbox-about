_We have complete authentication support_ ðŸ¥· This goes from basic stuff like sign up and sign in to a full-featured account management with multiple-email and device history âœ¨

_In the near future,_ signed in users will have more benefits, such as higher usage limit, better models, and the privilege of sending us money (to pay for the models, of course).

_As always, privacy is our first priority._ Even if you signed in, chats are always stored in your devices only. To learn more, see our [Privacy Policy](https://about.ask.box/legal/privacy) and [Terms of Use](https://about.ask.box/legal/terms).
