**We brought back the colours of companions ðŸ˜¶**
Recently, we ~had a bug~
let them go to the beach too much and their skins are burned.
After we ~fixed the bug~ let them rest,
they are back with their good old selves.

My apology to <ReleaseUser name="hai"/> and <ReleaseUser name="huy"/> who were most impacted by this ðŸ™‡
