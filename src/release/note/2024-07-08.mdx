**We updated all AI models ðŸ¥¬**
This brings us both [Claude 3.5][] and [Gemini 1.5][].
We also simplified Knowledge Base (interface to select AI model),
reducing to only the best models of each provider for you.

Lastly, we revised their description to be shorter,
less biased, and with more useful info,
such as when was their training data cutoff.
