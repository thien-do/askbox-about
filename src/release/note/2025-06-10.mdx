**We fixed a bug of accidental submission in some languages 🐞** 
Previously some languages like Vietnamese may trigger double answers, while some like Japanese may submit the message too soon. All are fixed now!

Thanks <ReleaseUser name="nhi"/> and <ReleaseUser name="chinh"/> (Pro) for reporting the bug 🙇
