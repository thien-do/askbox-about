**Another round of models has arrived üõ≥Ô∏è**
We now have OpenAI's
[o4-mini](https://openai.com/index/introducing-o3-and-o4-mini/),
Meta's
[Llama 4](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/)
Maverick and Scout, and an all-new Perplexity's
[Sonar](https://www.perplexity.ai/hub/blog/meet-new-sonar)
line-up.
As important, our companions' models are now automatically updated,
so there will be no "unknown model" anymore!

Thanks <ReleaseUser name="my"/> (Pro) and <ReleaseUser name="chinh"/> (Pro)
for reporting the "unknown" issue.
