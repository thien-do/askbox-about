**We now support down to 768 pixels of a screen ü§è**
This means you can use Ask Box on smol laptops, tablets,
and even phones in landscape position, with _complete_ functionality.

**Ask Box will support more screen sizes soon üéâ**
This comes from a personal need,
because in one of my jobs, I use a 1024 x 768 px screen.
Ask Box currently requires 1024 minimum width,
but with stage manager and browser frame,
my 1024 px only deliver around 900 px of browser width for good reasons.
So anyway, we push it a bit further
and Ask Box will soon only need 768 px to deliver!

**Fun fact, this means you can also use Ask Box on phones.**
768 is much smaller than most phone's screen height
(e.g., Pixel has 915 px, while iPhone has 844 px vertically).

**This is likely the furthest we can go though.**
The next breakpoint is around 500 px,
which is technically too small as Ask Box requires at least 600 px
to run the [zero-layout animation](#12).
We need another layout to reach phone in vertical screen.
