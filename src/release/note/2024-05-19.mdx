**We widened the chat area,** so you can scroll anywhere on the screen.
The scrollbar now stays at the edge, so it should never collide with your text.
Even better, we did this without impacting the recent [smooth animation](#12) ðŸŒ¸

In [farewell] of DevTool's Layers panel,
here's the secret sauce of Ask Box's silky smooth
(i.e., [zero-layout](#12)) animation ðŸŽ‰

**This technique leads to today's challenge of the "ugly scroll",**
which is deemed as a bug by almost 25% (3 persons) of all beta users,
including our own CEO / BE dev,
despite my protest that it was a feature.

The ~problem~ feature root ~cause~ reason _was_ that,
as shown in the Layers panel above,
there are not 1, nor 2,
but 3 layers to achieve the smooth animation!
In short, the Actual Chat does not know the layout of the Animating Chat,
thus the Actual Chat plays it safe and use a narrow,
fixed width instead of a fluid one.

That, my friends, is what I'll (hope to) fix today ðŸ¤ž
