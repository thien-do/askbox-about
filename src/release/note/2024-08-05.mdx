**We updated Meta Llama to their latest 3.1 version ðŸ¦™**
This is _the_ state-of-the-art open source large language model.
Llama also powered Perplexity Sonar, so that one got an update too.

As a reminder, while some models have internet access through tools,
Sonar has it natively, so give it a try the next time you want latest info.
