**Introducing Model Explorer** ðŸš 
Instead of a plain dropdown, now there's a full gallery to explore all models,
in a friendly, educational interface.
It has a section for everyone,
from first timer to explorer to experienced AI users.
And boy, does it work beautifully on mobile.

Our thanks to <ReleaseUser name="my" /> and <ReleaseUser name="hai"/>
for suggesting the feature ðŸ™‡
