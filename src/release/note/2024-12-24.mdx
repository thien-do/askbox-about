**Companion Model is more visible ðŸ”¦**
Companions now have their model right next to their name in important places,
such as the ask box.
Moreover, if you're fan of one companion per model,
we now support leaving the "name" field empty to automatically use its model's short name.

Thanks <ReleaseUser name="my" /> (Pro) and <ReleaseUser name="minh"/>
for suggesting the idea ðŸ™‡
