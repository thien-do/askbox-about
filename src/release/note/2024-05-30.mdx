**You can now `Cmd K` (or `Ctrl K`) from anywhere to start a new chat ðŸ§¼**
You no longer need to focus on the ask box first.
Even better, the ask box will be focused automatically for you
to start a new chat right away.

We also support `Cmd B` and `Cmd Shift B`
to toggle the home and settings panels, respectively.
For our friends on Windows and Linux,
they will be `Ctrl B` and `Ctrl Shift B`.

<ReleaseUser name="nhi"/>, and <ReleaseUser name="chinh"/>,
so thank you!
