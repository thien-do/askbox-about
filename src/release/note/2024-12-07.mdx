**Chat is now available _immediately_ right after load üê∞** Ask Box always take less than 1 second to load, but previously there was a 2-second warming up right after, where typing might be laggy. With multi-threading magic, we moved the warm-up to other place, so now the app is fully interactive as soon as you see it!

This does not only improve the initial experience but also the smoothness of every question! Now all heavy processing is done behind the scene, leaving the main thread fully for maximum animation frames üí®
