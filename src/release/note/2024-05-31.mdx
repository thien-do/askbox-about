**We use an emoji as our favicon ðŸ“®**
This is a short term solution while we are working with a real designer instead of me.
There's no meaning here, don't read too much into it.
It's just an emoji that will stand out in your hundred of tabs.

ðŸ™‡ Thanks <ReleaseUser name="nhi"/> for requesting this
(who actually did not say "favicon" but "something on the sidebar",
hopefully it's favicon)
